** WARNING The Legacy Drawing API is being deprecated in v0.26.0**

A flag must be used after v0.24.5 to use the legacy drawing api, you cannot mix it with new
Graphics API

```typescript
ex.Flags.enable('use-legacy-drawing');
const game = new ex.Engine(...)
```

## Sprites

To create a [[Sprite]] you need to have a loaded [[Texture]] resource. You can
then use [[Texture.asSprite]] to quickly create a [[Sprite]] or you can create
a new instance of [[Sprite]] using the constructor. This is useful if you
want to "slice" out a portion of an image or if you want to change the dimensions.

```js
const game = new ex.Engine()
const txPlayer = new ex.Texture('/assets/tx/player.png')
// load assets
const loader = new ex.Loader([txPlayer])

// start game
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  // create a sprite (quick)
  const playerSprite = txPlayer.asSprite()
  // create a sprite (custom)
  const playerSprite = new ex.Sprite(txPlayer, 0, 0, 80, 80)
})
```

You can then assign an [[Actor]] a sprite through [[Actor.addDrawing]] and
[[Actor.setDrawing]].

## Sprite Sheets

You can also use a [[SpriteFont]] which is special kind of [[SpriteSheet]] for use
with [[Label|Labels]].

### Creating a SpriteSheet

To create a [[SpriteSheet]] you need a loaded [[Texture]] resource.

```js
const game = new ex.Engine()
const txAnimPlayerIdle = new ex.Texture('/assets/tx/anim-player-idle.png')
// load assets
const loader = new ex.Loader([txAnimPlayerIdle])

// start game
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  const player = new ex.Actor()

  // create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
  const playerIdleSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet(txAnimPlayerIdle, 5, 1, 80, 80)

  // create animation (125ms frame speed)
  const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125)

  // add drawing to player as "idle"
  player.addDrawing('idle', playerIdleAnimation)
  // add player to game
  game.add(player)
})
```

### Creating animations

[[SpriteSheet|SpriteSheets]] provide a quick way to generate a new [[Animation]] instance.

You can use _all_ the frames of a texture using [[SpriteSheet.getAnimationForAll]]
or you can use a range of frames ([[SpriteSheet.getAnimationBetween]]) or you
can use specific frames ([[SpriteSheet.getAnimationByIndices]]).

To create an animation these methods must be passed an instance of [[Engine]].
It's recommended to generate animations for an actor [during initialization](/docs/actors#initialization) because the engine is passed to the initialization function. However, if your
engine instance is in the global scope, you can create an animation at any time
provided the texture has been [loaded](/docs/assets).

```js
// create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
const playerIdleSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet(txAnimPlayerIdle, 5, 1, 80, 80)

// create animation for all frames (125ms frame speed)
const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125)
// create animation for a range of frames (2-4) (125ms frame speed)
const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationBetween(game, 1, 3, 125)
// create animation for specific frames 2, 4, 5 (125ms frame speed)
const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationByIndices(
  game,
  [1, 3, 4],
  125
)
// create a repeating animation (ping-pong)
const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationByIndices(
  game,
  [1, 3, 4, 3, 1],
  125
)
```

<!-- TODO: Examples -->

### Multiple rows

Sheets are organized in "row major order" which means left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
Indexes are zero-based, so while you might think to yourself the first column is
column "1", to the engine it is column "0". You can easily calculate an index
of a frame using this formula:

    Given: col = 5, row = 3, columns = 10
    index = col + row * columns
    index = 4 + 2 * 10 // zero-based, subtract 1 from col & row
    index = 24

You can also simply count the frames of the image visually starting from the top left
and beginning with zero.

```js
// get a sprite for column 3, row 6
const sprite = animation.getSprite(2 + 5 * 10)
```

## Animations

### Creating an animation

Create a [[Texture]] that contains the frames of your animation. Once the texture
is [[Loader|loaded]], you can then generate an [[Animation]] by creating a [[SpriteSheet]]
and using [[SpriteSheet.getAnimationForAll]].

```js
const game = new ex.Engine()
const txAnimPlayerIdle = new ex.Texture('/assets/tx/anim-player-idle.png')
// load assets
const loader = new ex.Loader([txAnimPlayerIdle])
// start game
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  const player = new ex.Actor()

  // create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
  const playerIdleSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet(txAnimPlayerIdle, 5, 1, 80, 80)

  // create animation (125ms frame speed)
  const playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125)

  // add drawing to player as "idle"
  player.addDrawing('idle', playerIdleAnimation)
  // add player to game
  game.add(player)
})
```

## Sprite Fonts

### Generating the font sheet

You can use tools such as [Bitmap Font Builder](http://www.lmnopc.com/bitmapfontbuilder/) to
generate a sprite sheet for you to load into Excalibur.

### Creating a sprite font

Start with an image with a grid containing all the letters you want to support.

Once you load it into Excalibur using a [[Texture]] resource, you can create
a [[SpriteFont]] using the constructor.

For example, here is a representation of a font sprite sheet for an uppercase alphabet
with 4 columns and 7 rows:

```
ABCD
EFGH
IJKL
MNOP
QRST
UVWX
YZ
```

Each letter is 30x30 and after Z is a blank one to represent a space.

Then to create the [[SpriteFont]]:

```js
const game = new ex.Engine()
const txFont = new ex.Texture('/assets/tx/font.png')
// load assets
const loader = new ex.Loader([txFont])

// start game
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  // create a font
  const font = new ex.SpriteFont(
    txFont,
    'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ',
    true,
    4,
    7,
    30,
    30
  )
  // create a label using this font
  const label = new ex.Label('Hello World', 0, 0, null, font)
  // display in-game
  game.add(label)
})
```

If you want to use a lowercase representation in the font, you can pass `false` for `caseInsensitive`
and the matching will be case-sensitive. In our example, you would need another 7 rows of
lowercase characters.

### Font colors

When using sprite fonts with a [[Label]], you can set the [[Label.color]] property
to use different colors.

### Known Issues

**One font per Label**  
[Issue #172](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/172)

If you intend on changing colors or applying opacity effects, you have to use
a new [[SpriteFont]] instance per [[Label]].

**Using opacity removes other effects**  
[Issue #148](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/148)

If you apply any custom effects to the sprites in a SpriteFont, including trying to
use [[Label.color]], they will be removed when modifying [[Label.opacity]].

## Tile Maps

Tile maps are made up of [[Cell|Cells]] which can draw [[TileSprite|TileSprites]]. Tile
maps support multiple layers and work well for building tile-based games such as RPGs,
adventure games, strategy games, and others. Cells can be [[Cell.solid|solid]] so
that Actors can't pass through them.

We recommend using the [Tiled map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) to build your maps
and export them to JSON. You can then load them using a [[Resource|Generic Resource]]
and process them to create your levels. A [[TileMap]] can then be used as part of a
level or map class that adds enemies and builds game objects from the Tiled map.

### Creating a tile map

A [[TileMap]] is meant to be used in conjunction with a map editor. Creating
a tile map is fairly straightforward.

You need a tile sheet (see [[SpriteSheet]]) that holds all the available tiles to
draw. [[TileMap]] supports multiple sprite sheets, letting you organize tile sheets
to your liking.

Next, you need to populate each [[Cell]] with one or more [[TileSprite|TileSprites]]
using [[Cell.pushSprite]].

Once the [[TileMap]] is added to a [[Scene]], it will be drawn and updated.

You can then add [[Actor|Actors]] to the [[Scene]] and interact with the [[TileMap]].

In this example, we take in a map configuration that we designed (for example,
based on the exported structure of a JSON file).

```typescript
// define TypeScript interfaces to make our life easier
public interface MapDefinition {
  cells: MapCellDefinition[];
  tileSheets: IMapTileSheet[];
  width: number;
  height: number;
  tileWidth: number;
  tileHeight: number;
}

public interface MapCellDefinition {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  tileId: number;
  sheetId: number;
}

public interface MapTileSheet {
  id: number;
  path: string;
  columns: number;
  rows: number;
}

// create a Map class that creates a game map
// based on JSON configuration
public class Map extends ex.Scene {
  private _mapDefinition: IMapDefinition;
  private _tileMap: ex.TileMap;
  constructor(mapDef: IMapDefinition) {
    // store reference to definition
    this._mapDefinition = mapDef;
    // create a tile map
    this._tileMap = new ex.TileMap(0, 0, mapDef.tileWidth, mapDef.tileHeight,
      mapDef.width / mapDef.tileWidth, mapDef.height / mapDef.tileHeight);
  }
  public onInitialize() {
    // build our map based on JSON config
    // build sprite sheets
    this._mapDefinition.tileSheets.forEach(sheet => {

      // register sprite sheet with the tile map
      // normally, you will want to ensure you load the Texture before
      // creating the SpriteSheet
      // this can be done outside the Map class, in a Loader
      this._tileMap.registerSpriteSheet(sheet.id.toString(),
        new ex.SpriteSheet(new ex.Texture(sheet.path), sheet.columns, sheet.rows,
          this._mapDefinition.tileWidth, this._mapDefinition.tileHeight));
    });
    // fill cells with sprites
    this._mapDefinition.cells.forEach(cell => {
      // create a TileSprite
      // assume tileId is the index of the frame in the sprite sheet
      const ts = new ex.TileSprite(cell.sheetId.toString(), cell.spriteId);
      // add to cell
      this._tileMap.getCell(cell.x, cell.y).pushSprite(ts);
    }
  }
}

// create a game
const game = new ex.Engine();

// add our level (JSON from external source)
const map1 = new Map({ ... });
game.add("map1", map1);
game.start();
```

In a real game, you will want to ensure all the textures for the sprite sheets
have been loaded. You could do this in the [[Resource.processData]] function
of the generic resource when loading your JSON, before creating your `Map` object.

### Off-screen culling

The [[TileMap]] takes care of only drawing the portion of the map that is on-screen.
This significantly improves performance and essentially means Excalibur can support
huge maps. Since Actors off-screen are not drawn, this also means maps can support
many actors.

### Collision checks

You can use [[TileMap.collides]] to check if a given [[Actor]] is colliding with a
solid [[Cell]]. This method returns an intersection [[Vector]] that represents
the smallest overlap with colliding cells.
