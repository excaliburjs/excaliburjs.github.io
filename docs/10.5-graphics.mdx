Excalibur has a new graphics system that has been developed to hide the underyling
implementation. This allows optimizations like webgl batch rendering and shader
programs to increase the speed and power of our drawings. This new system does a great deal to reduce the complexity of the drawing stack for both developers using Excalibur and the maintainers.

### Experimental WebGL support

The new webgl support implements an automatic 2d batch renderer that dramatically improves draw performance.

To use this experiment turn on the flag before engine construction.

```typescript
ex.Flags.enable('use-webgl');
const game = new ex.Engine(...);
```

## Excalibur Graphics Context

This is an abstraction (`ex.Graphics.ExcaliburGraphicsContext`) over the underlying drawing mechanism and only knows how to draw `ex.Graphic` objects.

#### ImageSource

Loading images from files (png, jpeg, etc)

`ex.Graphics.ImageSource` is a new type in Excalibur that represents the source bitmap and contains the logic for loading that image from a file. You can thing of this as the file representation in Excalibur for the image.

These images can be presented to the loader at the start of an Excalibur game

```typescript
const game = new ex.Engine({ width: 800, height: 600 })

const image = new ex.Graphics.ImageSource('./img/myimg.png')

const loader = new ex.Loader()
loader.addResource(image)

game.start(loader).then(() => {
  // resources like ImageSource loaded before game started
})
```

Or they can be loaded out of band **Note: it is important to check that a ImageSource has been loaded before using it at runtime to avoid errors and visual bugs if your game is loading images this way.**

```typescript
const image = new ex.Graphics.ImageSource('./img/myimg.png')

image.load().then(() => {
  // image loaded
  // good for use in sprites inside this function
})

if (image.isLoaded()) {
  // image.data is good for use in sprites
}
```

## GraphicsComponent

There is a new component, `ex.GraphicsComponent` to work with these graphics with `ex.Actor`'s and other `ex.Entity`'s

The `ex.GraphicsComponent` alows users to manage graphics with Actors and Entities in an easy way

### Adding/Showing graphics

The graphics component allows developers to save named graphics to avoid passing around graphic object references if desired. These can be used to show specific graphics.

```typescript
actor.graphics.add('jump', jumpAnimation)
actor.graphics.show('jump') // display the graphic
// equivalent to
actor.graphics.show(jumpAnimation) // display the graphic
actor.graphics.hide() // hide the graphic
```

If no name is specified when added to the graphics component it is considered the 'default' graphic and is shown automatically.

```typescript
// graphic considered 'default' and displayed automatically
actor.graphics.add(jumpAnimation)
```

### Layers

The components adds a why multiple [graphics](#graphics) on top or behind each other for a certain actor or entity.

Layers can be ordered numerically, larger negative layers behind, and positive layers in front.

```typescript
actor.graphics.createLayer({ name: 'background', order: -1 })
actor.graphics.createLayer({ name: 'foreground', order: 1 })

actor.graphics.getLayer('background').show(myBackground)
actor.graphics.getLayer('foreground').show(myForeground)

// no longer display the background
actor.graphics.getLayer('background').hide()
```

There is always a layer named `'default'` at `order: 0`

```typescript
actor.graphics.show(myAnimation)
// is equivalent to
actor.graphics.getLayer('default').show(myAnimation)
```

### Component Specific Overrides

- `visible: boolean`

  - Shows or hides the all the graphics for this component

- `opacity: number`

  - Applies an opacity to all the graphics shown for this component

- `offset: Vector`

  - Offset in pixels to shift the graphics for this component

- `anchor: Vector`
  - Anchor to apply to all drawings in this component if set, if null the drawing's anchor is respected.

## Graphics

Excalibur `ex.Graphic`s break into 2 main categories, `ex.Graphic.Sprite` based and `ex.Graphic.Raster` based. That is to say Raster and non-Raster graphics.

`ex.Graphics` have a bunch of useful feature that work for ALL types of graphics

- `clone(): Graphic`

  - Returns a new deep copy of this graphic

- `width: number`

  - Gets or sets the width of the graphic

- `height: number`

  - Gets or sets the height of the graphic

- `flipHorizontal: boolean`

  - Gets or sets the flipHorizontal, which will flip the graphic horizontally (across the y axis)

- `flipVertical: boolean`

  - Gets or sets the flipVertical, which will flip the graphic vertically (across the x axis)

- `rotation: number`

  - Gets or sets the rotation of the graphic (in radians)

- `opacity: number`

  - Gets or sets the opacity of the graphic, 0 is transparent, 1 is solid (opaque).

- `scale: Vector`

  - Gets or sets the scale of the graphic, this effects the width and height of the graphics

- `origin: Vector`

  - Gets or sets the origin of the graphic, if not set the center of the graphic is the origin

#### Sprite

A sprite is a view into a [ex.Graphics.ImageSource](#ImageSource) and a projection into a final destination size.

```typescript
const image = new ex.Graphics.ImageSource('./img/myimage.png')
// keep in mind this wont work until the raw image is loaded
const sprite = new ex.Graphics.Sprite({
  ImageSource: image,
  sourceView: {
    // Take a small slice of the source image starting at pixel (10, 10) with dimension 20 pixels x 20 pixels
    x: 10,
    y: 10,
    width: 20,
    height: 20,
  },
  destSize: {
    // Optionally specify a different projected size, otherwise use the source
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
  },
})
```

Many times a sprite is the exact same view and size as the source [raw image](#ImageSource) so there is a quick static helper to do this

```typescript
const image = new ex.Graphics.ImageSource('./img/myimage.png')
// keep in mind this wont work until the raw image is loaded
const sprite = ex.Graphics.Sprite.from(image)
```

#### Animation

Animations are a series of graphics that take a specific duration in milliseconds. Each of these units is called a "Frame". There are a few playing strategies as well to consider

```typescript
export enum AnimationStrategy {
  /**
   * Animation ends without displaying anything
   */
  End = 'end',
  /**
   * Animation loops to the first frame after the last frame
   */
  Loop = 'loop',
  /**
   * Animation plays to the last frame, then backwards to the first frame, then repeats
   */
  PingPong = 'pingpong',

  /**
   * Animation ends stopping on the last frame
   */
  Freeze = 'freeze',
}
```

Animation frames can be created by hand in the following example

```typescript
const animation = new ex.Graphics.Animation({
  frames: [
    {
      graphic: newSprite,
      duration: 500,
    },
    {
      graphic: circle,
      duration: 1000,
    },
    {
      graphic: rect,
      duration: 1500,
    },
    {
      graphic: triangle,
      duration: 2000,
    },
  ],
})
```

Frames can contain tags of information

```typescript
var anim = new ex.Graphics.Animation({
  frames: [
    {
      graphic: playerGraphic,
      duration: 500,
      tags: {
        handPos: ex.vec(200, 200),
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

Animations can be constructed quickly from [`ex.Graphics.SpriteSheets`](#SpriteSheet)

```typescript
// Use the specified sprite sheet, take frames 1 - 10 (including 10), with a frame duration of 50 millseconds
const left = ex.Graphics.Animation.fromSpriteSheet(
  spriteSheetRun,
  ex.Util.range(1, 10),
  50
)
```

Animations also emit events per frame, per loop, and per end (if it completes).

```typescript
anim.on('loop', (a) => {
  console.log('loop')
})
anim.on('frame', (f) => {
  console.log('frame')
})
anim.on('ended', (a) => {
  console.log('ended')
})
```

### SpriteSheet

SpriteSheet is really an ordered collection of sprites from the same base image.

```typescript
const spriteSheet = new ex.Graphics.SpriteShet({
  image: imageRun,
  sprites: [...]
})
```

If you spritesheet is a neat grid there is a static builder for you to slice up that raw image.

```typescript
const spriteSheetRun = ex.Graphics.SpriteSheet.fromGrid({
  image: imageRun,
  grid: {
    rows: 1,
    columns: 21,
    spriteHeight: 96,
    spriteWidth: 96,
  },
})
```

### GraphicsGroup

A graphics group is an new graphic that draws a graphics in some relation to one another. This can be useful when you want to compose graphics together into a single graphic. Graphics groups do support all types of graphics including [animations](#Animation)

```typescript
const group = new ex.Graphics.GraphicsGroup({
  members: [
    {
      graphic: newSprite,
      pos: ex.vec(0, 0),
    },
    {
      graphic: newSprite,
      pos: ex.vec(50, 0),
    },
    {
      graphic: newSprite,
      pos: ex.vec(0, 50),
    },
    {
      graphic: text,
      pos: ex.vec(100, 20),
    },
    {
      graphic: circle,
      pos: ex.vec(50, 50),
    },
    {
      graphic: anim,
      pos: ex.vec(200, 200),
    },
    {
      graphic: triangle,
      pos: ex.vec(0, 200),
    },
  ],
})
```

### Raster

Rasters are a type of `ex.Graphic` built by constructing a bitmap (using CanvasRenderingContext2D) in memory which is then sent to the drawing context. This allows the use of features available to developers in the 2D canvas to produce Graphics for Excalibur.

Rasters are only rendered when they need to be, if no properties change on them, they are not recalculated. Rasters can be forced to be re-draw by calling `.flagDirty()`.

See these useful raster implemenations

- [Text](#Text)
- [Polygon](#Polygon)
- [Rectangle](#Rectangle)
- [Circle](#Circle)
- [Canvas](#Canvas)

A custom raster can be built implementing the `execute` function

```typescript
export class MyRaster extends ex.Graphics.Raster {
  constructor() {
    super()
  }

  execute(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D): void {
    // my custom raster
    ctx.fillStyle = 'blue'
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 20, 20)
  }
}
```

`ex.Raster` properties and methods

- `abstract execute(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D): void`

  - This is the bitmap generation implementation, this will construct the desired bitmap on the CanvasRenderingContext2D.

- `rasterize(): void`

  - This causes the underlying bitmap to be generated calling the `execute()` implementation in the process

### Text

Text is a [raster](#raster) [graphic](#graphic) that can be used to draw text to the screen, all of the normal things that can be done with [rasters](#raster) and [graphics](#graphic) can be done with text.

Text only supports normal OS and web fonts at this time, sprite fonts are not yet supported. Please see the [font](#Font) type for more info

Example

```typescript
var text = new ex.Graphics.Text({
  text: 'This is raster text ❤️',
  font: new ex.Graphics.Font({ size: 30 }),
})
```

#### Font

This specifies the font characteristics for a [text](#Text) raster.

Possible font options

```typescript
export interface FontOptions {
  size?: number
  unit?: FontUnit
  family?: string
  style?: FontStyle
  bold?: boolean
  textAlign?: TextAlign
  baseAlign?: BaseAlign
  direction?: Direction
  shadow?: {
    blur?: number
    offset?: Vector
    color?: Color
  }
}
```

```typescript
var text = new ex.Graphics.Text({
  text: 'This is raster text ❤️',
  font: new ex.Graphics.Font({
    size: 30,
    unit: FontUnit.Px,
    family: 'sans-serif',
    style: FontStyle.Normal,
    bold: false,
    textAlign: TextAlign.Left,
    baseAlign: BaseAlign.Alphabetic,
    direction: Direction.LeftToRight,
    shadow: {
      blur: 2,
      offset: ex.Vec(2, 2),
      color: ex.Color.Black,
    };
  })
});
```

#### SpriteFont

Sometimes you want to use text of your own creation from a [spritesheet](#spritesheet)

TODO

### Polygon

Polygon creates a rastered polygon graphic given a set of points

```typescript
const triangle = new ex.Graphics.Polygon({
  points: [ex.vec(10 * 5, 0), ex.vec(0, 20 * 5), ex.vec(20 * 5, 20 * 5)],
  color: ex.Color.Yellow,
})
```

### Circle

Circle creates a rastered circle graphic given a raidus

```typescript
const circle = new ex.Graphics.Circle({
  radius: 10,
  color: ex.Color.Red,
})
```

### Rectangle

Rectangle creates a rastered rectange graphic given a width and height

```typescript
const rect = new ex.Graphics.Rectangle({
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  color: ex.Color.Green,
})
```

### Canvas

The canvas is a special type of raster graphic that acts like a shim between direct CanvasRenderingContext2D drawing and the [ExcaliburGraphicsContext](#ExcaliburGraphicsContext)

This type of raster is re-rendered every time the graphic is drawn, thus it should be used sparingly due to this inefficiency.

```typescript
const canvas = new Canvas({
  drawHandler: (ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) => {
    ...
  }
});
```
