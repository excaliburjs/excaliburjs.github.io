### Issue: My [[Actor]] or [[Entity]] is not drawing on the screen:

Common fixes:

- Ensure your [[Actor]] or [[Entity]] is added to the correct [[Scene]].
- Add a name to your [[Actor]] or [[Entity]] and toggle debug to see if you can see it's name in debug
- Is your [[Actor]] or [[Entity]] offscreen? Check it's position in the debugger
