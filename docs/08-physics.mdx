Excalibur comes built in with two physics simulations.

- "Arcade" style physics which is good for basic collision detection for non-rotated rectangular areas.
  - Example: platformers, tile based games, top down, etc
- "Realistic" style physics which is good for rigid body games where realistic collisions are desired
  - Example: block stacking, angry bird's style games, etc

## Arcade

Arcade physics simulation is on by default, but can be enabled explicitly at any time with `ex.Physics.useArcadePhysics()`

```typescript
Physics.useArcadePhysics();

const game = new Engine({...});
```

## Realistic

Realistic physics are not on by default, but can be enabled explicitly at any time with `ex.Physics.useRealisticPhysics()`

```typescript
Physics.useRealisticPhysics();

const game = new Engine({...});
```

## Other Physics Settings

See [[Physics]] documentation for more

- Turn off excalibur physics `ex.Physics.enabled = false`
- Global acceleration applied to [[CollisionType.Active|active objects]] `ex.Physics.acc = ex.vec(0, 100)`
- Fast moving object detection (continuous collision) `ex.Physics.checkForFastBodies = true`
- Physics realistic passes, more passes mean higher quality simulation at the expense of cpu
  - Realistic solver position iterations, improves overlap resolution `ex.Physics.positionIterations = 3`
  - Realistic solver velocity iterations, improves response and stability `ex.Physics.velocityIterations = 8`

## Using Physics with Actors or Entities

The physics simulation has 2 major pieces for actors

1. [[BodyComponent]] - Controls the motion and qualities of the physics simulation
2. [[ColliderComponent]] - Stores the geometry of any collider and performs overlap testing

### Actors

Actors come out of the box with both of these components, an implicitly created [[BodyComponent]] and a [[ColliderComponent]]
of a [[ConvexPolygon|box]] that matches the specified `width` and `height`, or a [[CircleCollider|circle]]

```typescript
const actor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(200, 200),
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  collisionType: ex.CollisionType.Active,
})

const builtInBox = actor.collider.get()
```

### Entities

Reminder entities don't have anything pre-built, all Actors are Entities, but with the common built in features included.

```typescript
const entity = new ex.Entity([
  new TransformComponent(),
  new BodyComponent(),
  new ColliderComponent(),
])

const tx = entity.get(TransformComponent)

const body = entity.get(BodyComponent)

const collider = entity.get(ColliderComponent)
```

## Colliders

Colliders are abstractions over geometry in Excalibur, they implement the [[Collider]] interface and know how
to detect intersecions with other colliders, test ray casts, check point containment, etc.

Colliders attached to an [[Entity]] will have a [[Entity.owner]] populated.

<Note>

**Keep in mind** colliders are relative to the owner [[TransformComponent]], they only represent geometry relative to an entity [[TransformComponent]]. Colliders can be shifted using the [[Collider.offset]].

Colliders don't have a position in the world without an Actor/Entity with a position

</Note>

### CircleCollider

The [[CircleCollider]] defines a circular geometry and can be created and added to an actor

```typescript
// Actors have a built in circle collider if radius is set
const actorWithCircleCollider = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(5, 5),
  radius: 10,
})

// Alternatively you can define and set a collider yourself

const circle = new ex.CircleCollider({
  radius: 10, // 10 pixel radius
})

// or

const circle = ex.Shape.Circle(10) // 10 pixel radius

const actor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  collider: circle,
})

// Change the collider afterwards
actor.collider.set(circle)
```

### Box and PolygonCollider

The [[PolygonCollider]] allows the definition of arbitrary **convex** polygons. Convex meaning there are no dents in the shape, for example "Pac-Man" would be a non-convex shape.

A box collider is created using the PolygonCollider, there is a [[Shape.Box]] helper to build these.

```typescript
// Actors have a built in box collider if width/height are set
const actorWithBoxCollider = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  width: 100,
  height: 10,
})

// Alternatively you can define and set a collider yourself
const box = ex.Shape.Box(100, 10)

const actor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  collider: box,
})
```

A polygon collider can be defined using a set of points specified in clockwise order (also known as "winding").

```typescript
const triangle = new ex.PolygonCollider({
  points: [ex.vec(-100, 0), ex.vec(0, -50), ex.vec(100, 0)],
})
```

### EdgeCollider

An [[EdgeCollider]] can be used to define a single line collider.

They are useful for creating walls, barriers, or platforms in your game.

Edge points are relative to the Entity position, so begin of `(0, 0)` means it starts right on the top of the Entity [[TransformComponent]]

```typescript
const edge = new ex.EdgeCollider({
  begin: ex.vec(0, 0),
  end: ex.vec(100, 0),
})

const actor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  collider: edge,
})
```

### CompositeCollider

CompositeCollider can be used to attach multiple colliders to an entity at once. This can be useful when generating complex shapes, like for
example a capsule collider for a player Actor.

```typescript
// Capsule Collider
const capsule = new ex.CompositeCollider([
  ex.Shape.Circle(10, ex.vec(0, -20)),
  ex.Shape.Box(20, 40),
  ex.Shape.Circle(10, ex.vec(0, 20)),
])

const player = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  collider: capsule,
})
```

## Collision Events

## Collision Event Lifecycle

![Collision Events Diagram](/assets/images/docs/collisioneventdiagram.png)

### Collision Start "collisionstart"

The **collisionstart** event is fired when a [[Body|physics body]], usually attached to an actor, first starts colliding with another [[Body|body]], and will not fire again while in contact until the the pair separates and collides again.

Use cases for the **collisionstart** event may be detecting when an actor has touch a surface (like landing) or if a item has been touched and needs to be picked up.

```typescript
actor.on('collisionstart', () => {...})
// or
actor.body.collider.on('collisionstart', () => {...})
```

### Collision End "collisionend"

The **collisionend** event is fired when two [[Body|physics bodies]] are no longer in contact. This event will not fire again until another collision and separation.

Use cases for the **collisionend** event might be to detect when an actor has left a surface (like jumping) or has left an area.

```typescript
actor.on('collisionend', () => {...})
// or
actor.body.collider.on('collisionend', () => {...})
```

### Pre Collision "precollision"

The **precollision** event is fired **every frame** where a collision pair is found and two bodies are intersecting.

This event is useful for building in custom collision resolution logic in Passive-Passive or Active-Passive scenarios. For example in a breakout game you may want to tweak the angle of ricochet of the ball depending on which side of the paddle you hit.

```typescript
actor.on('precollision', () => {...})
// or
actor.body.collider.on('precollision', () => {...})
```

### Post Collision "postcollision"

The **postcollision** event is fired for **every frame** where collision resolution was performed. Collision resolution is when two bodies influence each other and cause a response like bouncing off one another. It is only possible to have _postcollision_ event in Active-Active and Active-Fixed type collision pairs.

Post collision would be useful if you need to know that collision resolution is happening or need to tweak the default resolution.

```typescript
actor.on('postcollision', () => {...})
// or
actor.body.collider.on('postcollision', () => {...})
```

## Collision Types

Colliders have the default collision type of [[CollisionType.PreventCollision]], this is so colliders don't accidentally opt into something computationally expensive. **In order for colliders to participate in collisions** and the global physics system, colliders **must** have a collision type of [[CollisionType.Active]] or [[CollisionType.Fixed]].

### Prevent

Actors with the [[CollisionType.PreventCollision]] setting do not participate in any
collisions and do not raise collision events.

### Passive

Actors with the [[CollisionType.Passive]] setting only raise collision events, but are not
influenced or moved by other actors and do not influence or move other actors.

### Active

Actors with the [[CollisionType.Active]] setting raise collision events and participate
in collisions with other actors and will be push or moved by actors sharing
the [[CollisionType.Active]] or [[CollisionType.Fixed]] setting.

### Fixed

Actors with the [[CollisionType.Fixed]] setting raise collision events and participate in
collisions with other actors. Actors with the [[CollisionType.Fixed]] setting will not be
pushed or moved by other actors sharing the [[CollisionType.Fixed]].

Think of `Fixed` actors as "immovable/unstoppable" objects. If two [[CollisionType.Fixed]] actors
meet they will not be pushed or moved by each other, they will not interact except to throw
collision events.

### Collision Type Behavior Matrix

This matrix shows what will happen with 2 actors of any collision type.

| Collision Type | Prevent |   Passive   |       Active        |        Fixed        |
| -------------- | :-----: | :---------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
| Prevent        |  None   |    None     |        None         |        None         |
| Passive        |  None   | Events Only |     Events Only     |     Events Only     |
| Active         |  None   | Events Only | Resolution & Events | Resolution & Events |
| Fixed          |  None   | Events Only | Resolution & Events |        None         |

- None = No collision resolution and no collision events
- Events Only = No resolution is performed, only collision events are fired on colliders, except for `postcollision` which only fires if resolution was performed.
- Resolution & Events = Collider positions are resolved according to their collision type and collision events are fired on both colliders

## Collision Groups

Collision groups are useful when you want to filter the collision that are possible between colliders
on a granular level above and beyond collision type. This idea is also known as collision layers, collision filters, or collision filtering.

Collision groups currently are a property on the [[BodyComponent]] because ??? TODO

```typescript
// Create a group for each distinct category of "collidable" in your game
const playerGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('player')
const npcGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('npcGroup')
const floorGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('floorGroup')
const enemyGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('enemyGroup')

// Define your rules
const playersCanCollideWith = ex.CollisionGroup.collidesWith([
  playersGroup, // collide with other players
  floorGroup, // collide with the floor
  enemyGroup, // collide with enemies
])

const enemiesCanCollideWith = ex.CollisionGroup.collidesWith([
  playerGroup, // collide with players
  floorGroup, // collide with the floor
])

const npcGroupCanCollideWith = ex.CollisionGroup.collidesWith([
  floorGroup, // only collides with the floor
])

const player = new ex.Actor({
  collisionGroup: playersCanCollideWith,
})

const npc = new ex.Actor({
  collisionGroup: npcGroupCanCollideWith,
})

const enemy = new ex.Actor({
  collisionGroup: enemiesCanCollideWith,
})

const floor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 400),
  width: 100,
  height: 20,
  collisionGroup: floorGroup,
})
```

## Collision System Under the Hood

## Example Active-Active/Active-Fixed scenario

```ts
// setup game
const game = new ex.Engine({
  width: 600,
  height: 400
});
// use rigid body
ex.Physics.collisionResolutionStrategy = ex.CollisionResolutionStrategy.RigidBody;
// set global acceleration simulating gravity pointing down
ex.Physics.acc.setTo(0, 700);

const block = new ex.Actor({
  pos: new ex.Vector(300, 0),
  width: 20,
  height: 20,
  color: ex.Color.Blue
});
block.body.useBoxCollider(); // useBoxCollision is the default, technically optional
block.body.collider.type = ex.CollisionType.Active;
game.add(block);

// or

const block = new ex.Actor({
    pos: new ex.Vector(300, 0),
    color: ex.Color.Blue,
    body: new ex.Body({
        collider: new ex.Collider({
            type: ex.CollisionType.Active,
            shape: ex.Shape.Box(20, 20)
        })
    })
});

const circle = new ex.Actor({
  x: 301,
  y: 100,
  width: 20,
  height: 20,
  color: ex.Color.Red
});
circle.body.useCircleCollider(10);
circle.body.collider.type = ex.CollisionType.Active;
game.add(circle);

// or

const circle = new ex.Actor({
    pos: new ex.Vector(301, 100),
    color: ex.Color.Red,
    body: new ex.Body({
        collider: new ex.Collider({
            shape: ex.Shape.Circle(10),
            type: ex.CollisionType.Active
        })
    })
});

const ground = new ex.Actor({
  x: 300,
  y: 380,
  width: 600,
  height: 10,
  color: ex.Color.Black;
});

ground.body.useBoxCollider(); // optional
ground.body.collider.type = ex.CollisionType.Fixed;

game.add(ground);
// start the game

game.start();
```
