// TODO does a first-time user need to internalize our ECS structure?

Excalibur has a built-in Entity Component System (ECS), which is a popular software technique in the video game industry
for managing game behavior in a composable and reusable way. Many ECS implementations also focus on memory cache optimization
techniques, but that is not a goal of the current Excalibur implemenation.

## What is an Entity-Component-System

The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) does a pretty good job of explaining the design pattern, but here is the quick overview:

- [[Entity]] - Any "thing" in the game that has behavior, it has an `id` place to to put components.
- [[Component]] - Any state for a particular entity; generally these are state only, but can contain small amounts of logic
- [[System]] - Implementation of behavior given a set of components on an entity

Many of the features in Excalibur are built using this, and users of Excalibur can make their own systems and/or replace
existing Excalibur systems.

## Excalibur ECS Implementation

In addition to [[Entity]], [[Component]], and [[System]], Excalibur also implements an ECS [[World]] where all of these
pieces live and can interact together. Each [[Scene]] in Excalibur contains an ECS world; they are not shared between scenes.

Inside an ECS [[World]] there is an [[EntityManager]], a [[QueryManager]], and a [[SystemManager]] that handle all the details.

- [[EntityManager]] - Manages all the entities known by the World. It is an [[Observer]] of entity component changes over time.
- [[QueryManager]] - Manages all the entity queries. A [[Query]] allows a search of all known entities by a set of component types.
- [[SystemManager]] - Manages all the systems known by the World. It updates a [[System]] in priority order (low to high) and gives them a set of entities that match types.

Excalibur [[Actor]]'s are in fact [[Entity]]'s in this ECS implementation. Actors come "pre-installed" with a set of components and features.
