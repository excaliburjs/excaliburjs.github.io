We are still pre-1.0 but Excalibur has many powerful features built-in already that make it simple
to build and design your games:

- Built with [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org) first
- [Fully-documented API](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/api/edge)
- Works in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE11) and most mobile browsers (Android Chrome, Apple Safari). We strive to support the last two major versions.
- HTML Canvas-based rendering engine
- Full Web Audio support and fallback HTML5 audio support
- Full HTML5 Gamepad API support
- Full keyboard, mouse, and touch support using a unified Pointers API
- Support for basic collisions
- Support for [rigid body physics system](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/api/edge/classes/_physics_.physics.html)
- Cross-platform support using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) or [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
- Simple `update`/`draw` pattern to keep logic and drawing separated
- Simple `Actor` model with `Scenes`, Actions API, cameras, and more
- Preloader API supporting resources like images, sounds, video, and generic resources
- Basic primitives like sprites, spritesheets, animations, and textures
- Sprite effects, particle emitters and post processor support

- and much more!
