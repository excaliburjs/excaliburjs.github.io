For drawing hooks the `ExcaliburGraphicsContext` replaces the browser `CanvasRenderingContext2D`. However, if you need to do some custom drawing using the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` the new [[Canvas]] graphic has your back.

The canvas is a special type of graphic that acts like a shim between direct CanvasRenderingContext2D drawing and the [ExcaliburGraphicsContext](#ExcaliburGraphicsContext)

This type of graphic is re-rendered every time the graphic is drawn, thus it should be used sparingly due to this inefficiency. It is recommended you use the `cache: true` property and call `flagDirty()` when there is something new to draw.

```typescript
const canvas = new Canvas({
  draw: (ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) => {
    ...
  }
});
```
