Excalibur supports building tile based games, often referred to as "TileMaps." Excalibur has a [Tiled plugin](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/pull/162) to support the popular [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) editor map files.

TileMaps can be useful tools to build levels for platformers or top down games.

### TileMap

TileMaps consist of a uniform grid of cells that can be solid or not. Each cell can have it's own graphics.

```typescript
const tileMap = new ex.TileMap({
  x: 100,
  y: 300,
  cellWidth: 20,
  cellHeight: 30,
  rows: 4,
  cols: 10,
})

tileMap.data.forEach((cell: ex.Cell) => {
  // Make each cell solid
  cell.solid = true
  // Add a sprite to a cell
  cell.addSprite(mySprite)
})
```

### Tiled plugin

The is a large update to the tiled plugin, we recommend you use that https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/pull/162 if it has not yet been merged.

### Currently unsupported

Hexagonal and Isometric TileMaps are not yet supported out of the box (but they are in our plans), but with some engenuity you can replicate them. I recommend reading some of the [material on Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/) for algorithms around Hexagonal and Isometric
