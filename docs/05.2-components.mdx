## Built-in Excalibur Components

### [[TagComponent]]

Tag components are useful when you want to flag an entity with something, for example "offscreen". A good way to think about it is to use a flag for a non-default state.

```ts
const entity = new ex.Entity()
entity.addComponent(new ex.TagComponent('offscreen'))

console.log(entity.tags) // ['offscreen']
```

### [[TransformComponent]]

The Excalibur TransformComponent component primarily keeps track of the [[TransformComponent.z|z-index]] [[TransformComponent.pos|position]], [[TransformComponent.rotation|rotation]], and [[TransformComponent.scale|scale]] of an entity.

Additionally, it keeps track of the [[TransformComponent.coordPlane|coordinate plane]] which determines if it draws to the [[CoordPlane.Screen]] or to part of the [[CoordPlane.World]].
The default behavior is to draw in the [[CoordPlane.World]], which shifts the entities in "world space" by the position of the current [[Camera]].
If you are drawing in [[CoordPlane.Screen]], the entity is not influenced by the camera (example: an entity at (0, 0) will always be at the top left of the screen, regardless of what happens to the current [[Camera]]).
