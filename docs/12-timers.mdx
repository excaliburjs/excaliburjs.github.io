Timers are useful for running tasks synchronized with the Excalibur update and framerate, using the browser `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.

## Timer

Timers can be created to repeat forever or for a fixed number of repeats.

Timers do not start until they are explicitly started with `.start()` and added to a `Scene`

```typescript
const timer = new ex.Timer({
  fcn: () => console.log('Every 100 ms'),
  repeats: true,
  interval: 100,
})

game.currentScene.add(timer)

timer.start()
```
