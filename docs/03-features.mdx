We are still pre-1.0 but Excalibur has many powerful features built-in already that let you focus on building and designing your games:

- Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) first
- [Fully-documented API](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/api/edge)
- Works in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and most mobile browsers (Android Chrome, Apple Safari). We strive to support the last two major versions.
- HTML Canvas-based rendering engine (WebGL is coming in 1.0!)
- [Actor model](/docs/actors) with [Scenes](/docs/scenes), cameras, and more
- Designed to keep [logic and drawing separated](/docs/intro)
- Asset loading for [images, sounds, video, and generic resources](/docs/assets)
- Basic [drawing primitives](/docs/drawings) like sprites, spritesheets, animations, and textures
- Support for [rigid body physics](/docs/physics)
- Game input with [keyboard, mouse, and gamepads support](/docs/input)
- Support for tile-based maps (with [Tiled support](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled))
- [Sprite effects, particle emitters and post processor support](/docs/fx)
- [Math API](/docs/math) with `Vectors`, `Rays`, `Lines`, `Projections`, and more
- Publish games using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), Ionic or anything else that supports a `WebView`
- [Utilities](/docs/utilities) such as logging API for debugging
- Promise-based async API
