Excalibur is a simple, free game engine written in TypeScript for making 2D games in HTML5 canvas. Our goal with Excalibur is to make it _incredibly simple_ to create and write 2D HTML/JS games aimed at folks new to game development all the way up to more experienced game developers. We take care of all the boilerplate engine code, cross-platform targeting, and more so you don’t have to. Use as much or as little as you need!

Excalibur is an open source project licensed under the 2-clause BSD license (this means you can use it in commercial projects!). It’s free and always will be. We welcome any feedback or contributions! If you make something with Excalibur, please [let us know](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/excaliburjs) so we can feature you in our online gallery.

Get started by [installing Excalibur](/docs/installation) in your project and [building your first game](/docs/getting-started), then dive in and learn [how to use Excalibur](/docs/intro). You can also check out the [examples](/examples) collection to see the engine in action with code samples!
