You may need to test if other colliders are nearby for your game, this might be for line of sight, for certain graphics effects, or for more complicated physics simulations.

You may arbitrarily ray cast into a scene and get a list of "hits"

```typescript
  const engine = new ex.Engine({...});
  const enemyGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('enemy');
  const ray = new ex.Ray(ex.vec(0, 0), ex.Vector.Right);
  const hits = engine.currentScene.physics.rayCast(ray, {
    /**
      * Optionally specify to search for all colliders that intersect the ray cast, not just the first which is the default
      */
    searchAllColliders: true,
    /**
      * Optionally specify the maximum distance in pixels to ray cast, default is Infinity
      */
    maxDistance: 100,
    /**
      * Optionally specify a collision group to consider in the ray cast, default is All
      */
    collisionGroup: enemyGroup
  });
```
