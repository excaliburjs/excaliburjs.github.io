Excalibur has a built in Entity Component System (ECS for short), which is a popular software technique in the video game industry
for managing behavior in a game in a composable and resuable way. Many ECS implementations also focus on memory cache optimization
techniques, that is not a goal of the current Excalibur implemenation.

## What is an Entity-Component-System

The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) article does a pretty good job of explaining the.

- [[Entity]] - Any "thing" in the game that has behavior, it has an id place to to put components.
- [[Component]] - Any state for a particular entity, generally these are state only, but can contain small amounts of logic
- [[System]] - Implementation of behavior given a set of components on an entity

Many of the features built in Excalibur are built using this, and users of Excalibur can make their own systems and/or replace
existing excalibur systems.

## Excalibur ECS Implementation

In addition to the familiar [[Entity]], [[Component]], and [[System]], Excalibur also implements an ECS [[World]] where all of these
pieces live and can interact together. Each [[Scene]] in Excalibur conatins an ECS world, they are not shared between scenes.
TODO need to have multi-scene recommendation

Inside an ECS [[World]] there is an [[EntityManager]], [[QueryManager]], and [[SystemManager]] that handle all the details.

- [[EntityManager]] - Manages all the entities known by the world, it is an [[Observer]] of entity component changes over time.
- [[QueryManager]] - Manages all the entity queries, a [[Query]] allows a search of all known entities by a set of component types.
- [[SystemManager]] - Manages all the systems known by the world, it updates a [[System]] in priority order (low to high) and gives them a set of entities that match types.

Excalibur [[Actor]]'s are in fact [[Entity]]'s in this ECS implementation. Actors come "pre-installed" with a set of components and features.

## Implementing your own Components & Systems

To build your own component, extend the Excalibur [[Component]] abstract class and pick a unique type name (duplicate type names will cause problems).

In this example, we create a "search" type component, that searches for a target position. Notice how this component implementation is mostly data.

```ts
class SearchComponent extends ex.Component<'search'> {
  public readonly type = 'search'
  constructor(public target: ex.Vector) {}
}
```

[[Actor]] comes prebuilt with other components and functionality, or build an empty [[Entity]] from scratch! In this example we use actor and add our new component in the `onInitialize`.

```ts
class Explorer extends ex.Actor {
  onInitialize() {
    // Excalibur Actors already has some components pre-installed
    // Like this one that keeps track of the position -> `this.addComponent(new ex.TransformComponent);`
    // And this one that knows how to draw -> `this.addComponent(new ex.CanvasDrawComponent((ctx, delta) => this.draw(ctx, delta)));`

    // Add your new component in
    this.addComponent(new SearchComponent(ex.vec(100, 100)))
  }
}
```

To implement this behavior as a system, extend the Excalibur [[System]] abstract class and pick the types this system should operate on.

```ts
class SearchSystem extends ex.System<
  ex.TransformComponent | SearchAIComponent
> {
  // Types need to be listed as a const literal
  public readonly types = ['transform', 'search'] as const

  // Run this system in the "update" phase
  public systemType = System.Update

  private _searchSpeed = 10 // pixels/sec

  public update(
    entities: Entity<ex.TransformComponent | SearchComponent>[],
    delta: number
  ) {
    for (let entity of entities) {
      const target = entity.components.search.target
      // ex.TransformComponent is a built in type
      const transform = entity.components.transform

      const motion = target.sub(transform.pos).size(this._searchSpeed)

      // Moves these entities towards the target at 10 pixels per second
      transform.pos = transform.pos.add(motion.scale(delta / 1000))
    }
  }
}
```

Any entity that has the new component attached will be processed by the new system once added to the world!

```ts
class MainLevel extends ex.Scene {
  onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine) {
    // Excalibur has some systems built in
    // If you want to opt out and define your own `this.world.clearSystems()` will remove them

    // Setup your new system in the ECS world and any others you want
    this.world.add(new SearchSystem())

    // Add your actors
    this.add(new Explorer())
  }
}
```
